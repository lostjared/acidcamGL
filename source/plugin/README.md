This is where I test/play around with  new code before adding it to libacidcam

Make sure you have opencv and libacidcam installed and
run 

$ make

to build and install to plugin folder in this tree

and

$ make clean

to clean up

you will need to set the plugin path as an exported enviorment variable


$ export AC_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/plugins
